# benpiper/aws-powershell

## Cross-platform PowerShell scripts for doing cool things with AWS VPC, ELB, and Route 53. PowerShell: it's not just for Windows anymore!

*Baked with love for PowerShell Core!*

### Really basic instructions:
If you don't already have the AWS PowerShell SDK installed, [Install-AWSPowerShell.ps1](Install-AWSPowerShell.ps1) has got you covered. It will detect your PowerShell version (Desktop or Core) and install and import the appropriate AWS PowerShell module.
```
. ./Install-AWSPowerShell.ps1
Install-AWSPowerShell
```
